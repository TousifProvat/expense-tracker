# expense-tracker
This is an expense tracker.You can track your expenses.You can track what on you spend your money, where you get your money from. There's a balance section to show your current balance. This is a really helpful site to track.you can download this code and host this site for your personal use because this has no account creation option to separate individual's.

What did I use:
1. React for Frontend (hooks, context)
2. Css for visuals
3. Nodejs for Backend (express) 

 Made this by watching "Traversy Media's" tutorial "Expense Tracker part 1 & 2". It is a fullstack site(MERN).
